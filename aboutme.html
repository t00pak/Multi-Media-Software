        <h2><span>About</span> Me</h2>
        <h5>Brother, Student, Thinker.</h5>
        <p> I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and plan on changing to Cybersecurity when I transfer. My goal for college is to have enough knowledge and experience to become a pen- tester (hacker). My dream job has changed a lot during the pandemic but at this point, it is to become a cybersecurity architect for one of the major cell phone providers. As more and more people get a variety of phones whilst only being able to have a select few of providers. More and more data breaches happen every year and I believe I can do their jobs more effectively.

            During my free time, I play with my pitbull, Tiko, and play video games. I am a film and TV nerd, I have recently been watching abstract films such as: "Pig", "Donny Darko", "Devils Advocate" and recently "Everything Everywhere All at Once". I'm a huge rap/r&b fan, my favorite albums of the year so far could include: "Tana Talk 4", "Ghetto Gods", "Caprisongs", and "Good Morning Gorgeous". If we were at a convention you will recognize me because I would cosplay as Baki Hanma.</p>
